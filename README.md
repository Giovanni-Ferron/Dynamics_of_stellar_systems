# Dynamics of stellar systems
Repository with code for the analysis of simulations of stellar systems. It contains exercises for the course of Dynamics of Stellar Systems at University of Milano Bicocca.
The simulations run are:

- A two-body problem with point-like masses.
- The collapse of a truncated homogenous sphere (using a direct summation code).
- The collapse of a truncated homogenous sphere (using a tree code).
- A Plummer sphere distribution in equilibrium.
- A perturber body inside of a Plummer sphere, to test dynamical friction.
- A Plummer sphere representing a star cluster, run for about 45 relaxation times to test core collapse, evaporation and mass segregation (denoted as "Project").

The direct N-body simulations were run using the [Nbody_sh1](https://www.ias.edu/exids/piet-hut-listing-n-body-starter-code) code by P. Hut, J. Makino and S. McMillan.\
The tree code simulations were run using the [treecode](https://home.ifa.hawaii.edu/users/barnes/treecode/treeguide.html) by Joshua E. Barnes.
